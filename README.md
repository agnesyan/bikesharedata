# Exploring Bike-share Data

## Project Purpose:

To use Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities
in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. This is a project from the
[Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). This project requires python3 to run, I also chose
to use the pandas library.
